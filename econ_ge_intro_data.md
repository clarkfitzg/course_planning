Meeting with Michelle Norris, Kristin Van Gaasbeck, and Clark Fitzgerald

Kristin's idea is to offer a course introducing data science to students who otherwise wouldn't be exposed to it.
The course would cover basic data analysis for students who had never seen programming before- R and markdown.
It would count as an upper division Area B5 GE course, thus fulfilling the college wide requirement for students to take these courses.
It would have as minimal prerequisites as possible, say just STAT 1.
