__Course Description:__
Computer methods for accessing, transforming, summarizing, graphing, and making statistical inferences from data.
Focus is on open-source, command-line software, but menu-driven statistical software may be introduced.
Students will learn to apply computer methods to solve problems selected from the areas of modeling, simulation, inference and statistical learning.
The intent of this course is to provide students with the software skills needed for statistical work in industry or academia.
3 units.


## Course Materials

__Textbook:__

__Computer and Internet Access:__
You'll need a computer or tablet with reliable internet to attend course meetings and office hours through Zoom video.
The screen should be at least 8 inches so that you can see my handwritten notes.
I highly recommend you turn on your video so that you can have better interactions with your classmates in group activities.
Headsets and noise cancelling headphones can be very useful if you live with other people.

__Other Technologies:__
We'll use technology for a couple other activities besides class meetings.
We will:

- Make videos, so you'll need access to a smartphone, webcam, or at least a microphone.
    Video editing software is nice, but not essential.
- Scan and upload your homework and exam submissions, so you'll need access to a smartphone, tablet, or a scanner.

__Inclusive Access:__
If you have trouble obtaining any of these materials, please contact me ASAP so we can work out alternatives.
Many resources are available to help you succeed.
For example, I can request a [long term laptop checkout](https://www.csus.edu/information-resources-technology/teaching-learning/laptop-checkout.html) for you.


## Grading

Possibilities

- Assignments: actual data analysis, produce a nice written report. Takes a few hours.
- Exercises: short programming assignments to reinforce concepts from class.
    The [exercises in The Book of R](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-book-of/9781492017486/xhtml/ch02.xhtml#ch02lev2sec19) look useful, and I know Advanced R has exercises.
- Quizzes: automatically graded.
    Could have questions of the form, "suppose you have two vectors x and y. Write the function call to display a scatter plot of x and y"
    The results of these quizzes would be very useful for me- shows me what they understand.
    If they take out their notes and briefly look at them- that's what I'm looking for.
- Final project: culmination of ideas in class. Probably a Shiny dashboard, since we will spend plenty of time on that in the end.
- Midterms: worth doing one to prepare students for the format of the final.
- Final: probably not worth much
- Video data analysis presentations
- Video reviews: could do on key concepts before midterm and final

My biggest goal is probably to get them comfortable writing functions.
So that's probably what the exercises and assessment should focus on.

Percentage  |   Category    |   Description & Purpose     |   Collaboration Policy
----------  |   --------    |   -----------     |   ----------------------
5           | Practice Problems |   These are questions where the answer is available at the back of the book, so that you can (and should!) check your work make sure you're on the right track. I won't grade these; if you turn something in you'll get full points. I may look over the submissions occasionally to see how you're doing. The purpose is to give you practice with standard calculations and concepts, and to encourage regular review.  |   Collaboration is allowed.
25          | Homework      |   These problem will challenge you more than the practice problems. I will grade a subset of these problems to provide you with feedback on your work, and allow you an opportunity to resubmit to correct any mistakes.    |   Talking about problems is allowed, but you must state who you work with.
10          | Interview     |   Plan to meet with me at least once for a brief individual Zoom interview. I will announce the details, but plan on explaining both high level ideas in the course, and any work that you've turned in.  This keeps you accountable for everything you turn in.     |   You can talk to me.
15          | Participation |   This category includes setting up online profiles, Canvas discussions, making review videos, and anything that doesn't fit cleanly somewhere else. The purpose is to think about statistics at a higher level than solving problems, and to make our online class feel more like a community by having some interaction with each other.    |   Collaboration is allowed.
20          | Midterms      |   Midterms will be similar to the homework, with a format that prepares you for the final. You will have an opportunity to resubmit the written parts to correct any mistakes. |   Do not collaborate.
25          | Final         |   This is a standard final exam to assess how well you've learned the class concepts. It will be due at the end of the semester, which means you will NOT have an opportunity to resubmit it or turn it in late. |   Do not collaborate.

The goal of this grading scheme is to minimize the pressure on you, the student.
Fall 2020 is highly unusual with the switch to online classes amidst the global COVID-19 pandemic, and I've adapted by changing the course in the following ways:

1. Less weight on high stakes assessments
1. Fewer timed assessments
2. More flexibility around due dates and resubmissions
3. Adding an interview component

I'm not saying the course will be easy for you.
To succeed, you'll need to demonstrate that you understand the concepts, which will require many hours of focused studying.

__Late Assignments:__
Due dates keep you on track; they benefit you!
If you realize you're going to be late, then please submit what you have on the due date, and let me know in a submission comment what's going on and when you expect to finish.
If you have a personal emergency or schedule disruption, then communicate with me, and tell me what you need.
A one time due date extension of a few days is no problem in most cases.

__Final Grades:__
The course grade cutoffs will follow the conventional scheme:

- 90-100% A
- 80-90% B
- 70-80% C
- 60-70% D
- Below 60% F

I may adjust these grade cutoffs lower, so that students receive higher grades.
I will not raise the cutoffs.
This means, for example, that if you score 80% of the points, then your course grade will be a B- or better.


## Academic Honesty

All assignments and midterms are open book, open notes, open internet.
If you happen to find a solution for the exact question online, please let me know.

Submit your own assignments, always.
Don't copy others' work, because that wastes everyone's time.
On the above assignment sections, "Collaboration is allowed" means you can help each other and work freely together, no worries.
"Do not collaborate" means you shouldn't receive any outside assistance, so don't talk about them.
The only exception is that you can ask me, the instructor, for clarification.

The category of the homework requires the most explanation.
You may work together and talk through the problems, but you need to understand each and every step in the solution that you turn in.
If you work together, please note on your submission who you worked with, and on which parts.

It's your responsibility to know and adhere to the University Policies regarding academic honesty, available at the following URL's:

- https://www.csus.edu/student-affairs/student-conduct/academic-dishonesty.html
- https://www.csus.edu/umanual/student/stu-100.htm

I will fully prosecute violations of these policies.
If you have any question about what's appropriate, please ask.


## Class Meetings

Class will meet synchronously through Zoom on MWF, one section at 8 AM and one section at 10 AM.
You may attend either section, as I plan to cover the same content in each lecture.

__Attendance:__
Class is where we'll cover the core material and do practice problems and other interactive activities, so plan on attending.
Experience shows that students perform better when they attend class, even online.

__Studying:__
Expect to spend approximately 8 hours on activities outside of class for every 4 hours in class.
Some weeks will require more, some less.
You may find yourself spending more time if you need to review prerequisite math concepts, or you're working hard to earn a good grade.
That's OK!

__Recording:__
I plan to record class meetings and make them available if you need to miss class for any reason.
Zoom recordings will be available through Canvas for current students in this course for this semester only, and not to the general public.
Do not make personal recordings of class meetings, or allow anyone not in this course to access course video recordings.
This policy means that students can have the same expectation of privacy in a virtual classroom as they have in a physical classroom.
Zoom breakout rooms are not recorded.


## Writing Component

STAT 50 is an area B4 GE course and has a writing component. To satisfy the writing requirement graded
assignments involving writing and understanding of complex technical prose, interpretation of theoretical
ideas, and the use of mathematical ideas will be part of the course.


## Area B-4 Mathematical Concepts and Quantitative Reasoning Student Learning Outcomes

Students will be able to:

1. Solve problems by thinking logically, making conjectures, and constructing valid mathematical arguments.
2. Make valid inferences from numerical, graphical and symbolic information.
3. Apply mathematical reasoning to both abstract and applied problems, and to both scientific and non-scientific problems.
