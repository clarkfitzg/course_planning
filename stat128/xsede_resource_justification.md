## Resource Justification

I am requesting a small educational allocation on Bridges for my 32 students in STAT 128, Statistical Computing, at California State University, Sacramento.
In this course, the students will learn to use R and Rstudio to solve applied statistics problems using real data.
I would like the students to use [Rstudio through OnDemand](https://portal.xsede.org/psc-bridges#ondemand:jupyterhub-rstudio) for one project involving a large data set so that they can experience remote computing for the first time.

The students need access to remote machines with sufficient memory to complete this project.
In the class, students will learn standard ways to program in R for data that fits in memory.
If the student has a modest computer with limited memory, and the data and intermediate results do not fit in memory, then their programs may not run.
Similarly, a student with a single personal computer might not be able to wait 20 hours for a program to run, because they need to use that same computer for other classes.

An XSEDE educational allocation will make this class more equitable, because all students will have access to a common, high quality resource for the computationally intensive project.
In the mathematics and statistics department, we do not have access to compute servers.
Equitable access is particularly important at Sacramento State, where many students come from low income families.
