## Resource Justification

I am requesting a small educational allocation on Bridges for my 32 students in STAT 128, Statistical Computing, at California State University, Sacramento.
In this course, the students will learn to use R and Rstudio to solve applied statistics problems using real data.
I would like the students to use [Rstudio through OnDemand](https://portal.xsede.org/psc-bridges#ondemand:jupyterhub-rstudio) for one project involving a large data set so that they can experience remote computing for the first time.
Access to XSEDE will make this class more equitable, because all students will have access to a common, high quality resource for the computationally intensive project.
Equitable access is particularly important at Sacramento State, where many students come from low income families.

Memory and compute times are the specific issues I foresee with the project.
The students will learn standard ways to compute on data that fits in memory using R.
If the student has a machine with small memory, and the data and intermediate results do not fit in memory, then their programs may not run.

I anticipate two specific issues with

R works well when the data fits in memory.
instead of struggling with limitations on their personal laptops.
