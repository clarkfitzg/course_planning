Course Description: Computer methods for accessing, transforming, summarizing, graphing, and making statistical inferences from data.
Focus is on open-source, command-line software, but menu-driven statistical software may be introduced.
Students will learn to apply computer methods to solve problems selected from the areas of modeling, simulation, inference and statistical learning.
The intent of this course is to provide students with the software skills needed for statistical work in industry or academia.
3 units.

Idea: Learn to program through simple experiments.
Lectures are going to be very interactive.

Curiousity is an essential skill for a data scientist to develop.
All the assignments should include some question like, what's one surprising thing you noticed in this data set?
