In this homework, we'll analyze R's included `precip` dataset, which contains "Annual Precipitation in US Cities".

    Cross reference with an external source to find out what units this data set is in.
2. Verify Sacramento is in the data.
2. Which city receives the most rain? The least rain?
2. Which city is closest to the mean rainfall? The farthest from the mean rainfall?
2. Which city is closest to the median rainfall? The farthest from the median rainfall?
2. Plot a histogram of precipitation.
    Interpret this histogram in one or two sentences.
