planning and developing data science courses

------------------------------------------------------------

What should data scientists be able to do?


#### Basic:

We can introduce these skills through two courses, one lower division, and one upper division (STAT 128).

- Analyze data sets in standard formats using a high level language, probably R or Python
- Apply standard statistical models, for example, linear regression
- Interpret findings and inferences to non expert audience
- Create static visualizations


#### Intermediate:

- Understand relational schema, and query SQL database
- Write reasonably efficient data analysis programs that work on data that fits in memory
- Create dashboards and more complex data visualizations


#### Advanced:

These skills start to get more specialized.
They take a long time to develop true expertise, and it may be difficult to justify one class that does 

- Software development, including unit tests
- Expert level statistical modeling, such as MCMC
