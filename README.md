planning and developing data science courses

------------------------------------------------------------

What should data scientists be able to do?

------------------------------------------------------------

#### Analysis

Level 1:

- Summarize univariate data
- Model relationships between two numeric variables, such as correlation
- Understand sampling bias

Level 2:

- Apply standard statistical models, such as linear regression
- Identify outliers
- Impute or otherwise correctly handle missing data
- Model non numeric data, including categorical
- Validate models, for example through cross validation

Level 3:

- Expert level statistical modeling, such as MCMC
- Adapt and develop appropriate statistical methodology to the task at hand


#### Presentation

This category is unique, because all levels of data scientist should be able to __do__ the same things.
The difference is in how well they do them.

- Write technical reports in standard formats
- Produce publication quality plots
- Summarize results for a general audience in brief oral presentations
- Develop interactive, online dashboards


#### Data Manipulation

Level 1:

- Load data in common standard formats, such as a CSV file

Level 2:

- Process data in less structured formats, for example, unstructured text
- Process hierarchical data, including JSON and XML.
- Understand relational schemas, and query SQL databases

Level 3:

- Select and apply appropriate technologies to process challenging data sets, such as those larger than memory
- Develop new relational schemas


#### Software Engineering

Level 1:

- Write and save scripts written in a high level language, probably R or Python
- Comment code enough to understand and change it later
- Correctly use relative and absolute file paths

Level 2:

- Organize code into small, reusable functions
- Write reasonably efficient programs 
- Understand the strengths and weaknesses of their particular software environment
- Run code on remote computers
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Backup code

Level 3:

- Develop robust software for use by others using language specific models, including object oriented models
- Interface with compiled languages and native code
- Collaborate with other software developers through remote version control
- Read and understand implementation source code, and possibly contribute

Old material

#### Basic:

We can introduce these skills through two courses, one lower division, and one upper division (STAT 128).

- Load and analyze data sets in standard formats using a high level language, probably R or Python
- Apply standard statistical models, for example, linear regression
- Interpret findings and inferences to non expert audience
- Create static visualizations


#### Intermediate:

- Understand relational schema, and query SQL database
- Write reasonably efficient data analysis programs, understand when performance is a problem
- Automate repetitive tasks through scripts
- Create dashboards and more complex data visualizations


#### Advanced:

These skills start to get more specialized.
They take a long time to develop true expertise, and it may be difficult to justify one class that focuses exclusively 

- Software development, including unit tests
- Expert level statistical modeling, such as MCMC
