## CSC 134 DBMS

Entity-Relationship (ER) model; relational model; relational database design by ER-to-relational mapping; design of applications using database technology; SQL; schema definition, constraints, and queries; relational algebra; data normalization; access methods such as indexing and hash structures; introduction to transaction processing.


## Data Analytics and Mining.

Theory and implementation of techniques for data analytics and mining with emphasis on big data. Topics include data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, feature engineering, classification, clustering, association rule mining, predictive model evaluation, parameter tuning, natural language processing, and selected advanced data mining topics. Design and implementation of systems using contemporary data analysis and mining programming libraries for automatic discovery of patterns and knowledge.
