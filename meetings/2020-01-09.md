Meeting Coskun and Michelle at CSUS to talk about data science curriculum.

Agenda:

What's the expected timeline on developing the data science certificate program?

Regarding timeline, word is I'll be teaching STAT 128 in Fall 2020.
It would be difficult for me to simultaneously develop and teach a completely different course, such as the "introduction to machine learning" that Michelle proposed.
But I could probably develop and teach 

Is it possible to offer a lower division, more introductory course with light prerequisites to cater to a wider audience?
I'm thinking of a course that gets students doing exploratory analysis and plotting of real data sets, learning the basics of how to analyze and interpret it.
The idea is that the students could learn "enough to be dangerous" :), and whet their appetite for working with data.
Perhaps we could partner with a local community college here?
