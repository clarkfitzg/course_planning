For STAT 50 I want to use more standard problems.
They should all fall into well recognized patterns- Bayes theorem, etc.
Some can be hard- that's OK.
The core course learning outcomes are being able to recognize and solve these problems.

Other outcomes include:

- Critically analyzing statistics and methodologies from various sources
- Basic calculations with R

My biggest question right now is how to design the grading scheme.
The original grading scheme was very typical for a math class:

- 5% Participation come to class, participate in activities
- 10% Homework each assignment is weighted equally. No makeups, lowest score will
be dropped.
- 10% Quizzes each quiz is weighted equally. No makeups, lowest score will be dropped.
- 40% Midterms each midterm is weighted equally. No makeups, lowest score will be
dropped.
- 35% Comprehensive Final Be there :)

I don't think this works at all online.

I definitely want to incorporate something team based during the class sessions.

I think having a retake policy with minimal penalty could make for a good disincentive for cheating.
Many small quizzes sounds better than big midterms.
Want to use games / team games.

We have Gradescope, which means grading actual handwritten work is feasible.

I don't really want to have projects in this class.
We'll already have homework, quizzes, discussions, videos, and midterms, which seems like enough.

I don't want to require synchronous quizzes- even though it could help mitigate cheating, there are too many logistic issues.

I should be really clear on which categories students can collaborate on, versus which I expect them to do individually, and find a balance between them.
I could have one category called "individual assignments".
Hmm, I wonder if Mcgraw Hill can randomize individual assignments?
Maybe it doesn't matter that much- the answers are still available.

Another tool at my disposal is to grade fewer problems than I assign.

Mcgraw Hill gives them practice with basic problems, along with in depth solutions (usually) and the ability to check their work.
The problem is that they can easily find the answers.
Mcgraw Hill should be worth something, so that they do it, but not too much.
10% sounds good.

How am I going to manage my workload?
One idea is to post student solutions to assignments that I grade in detail.
This saves me the work of having to write out the solution, and helps them review.

How to ensure academic integrity?
I'd like to disincentivize cheating as much as possible.


### Potential Activities

- homework, Mcgraw Hill automated
- homework, Mcgraw Hill manual
- discussions, read a relevant news article and analyze the statistics used.
    They can submit responses in videos or text.
- quizzes, Mcgraw Hill
- quizzes, Canvas
- written quiz where I give personal feedback
- written hw where I give personal feedback
- projects
- games, competition
- comprehensive final


### Grading Scheme

- 15% participation
    - discussions, for example, read a relevant news article and analyze the statistics used.
    - profile pics
    - review videos
    - comprehension quizzes?
    - survey?
    - peer feedback?
    - challenge questions?
- 20% midterms, timed online and take home parts.
    Students can retake both parts.
- 30% comprehensive final.
    This will be similar to the midterms.

Idea: facilitate study groups

Percentage  |   Category    |   Description & Purpose     |   Collaboration Policy
----------  |   --------    |   -----------     |   ----------------------
10          | Practice Problems |   Online homework allows you to instantly check your work and see solutions, so that you can make sure you're on the right track. The purpose is to give you practice with standard calculations and concepts.   |   I encourage you to work closely with others.
25          | Homework      |   Expect these problem sets to challenge you more than those on the automated homework. I will grade a subset of these problems to provide you with feedback on your work, and allow you an opportunity to resubmit to correct any mistakes.    |   You may talk with others about general approaches to the problem, but I expect the submitted solution to be your own unique work.
15          | Participation |   This category includes setting up online profiles, Canvas discussions, making review videos, and anything that doesn't fit cleanly somewhere else. The purpose is to make our online class feel more like a community by having some interaction with each other.    |   I encourage you to work closely with others.
20          | Midterms      |   Midterms will be similar to the homework, with a format that prepares you for the final. You will have an opportunity to resubmit the written parts to correct any mistakes. |   Do not collaborate.
30          | Final or Oral |   This is a standard final exam to assess how well you've learned the class concepts. It will be due at the end of the semester, which means you will NOT have an opportunity to resubmit. If there is any question on whether you followed the collaboration policy in this course, then I may schedule a one on one oral exam through Zoom video chat. The oral exam will be no more difficult than the written exam. |   Do not collaborate.

The general idea of this grading scheme is to minimize the pressure on you, the student.
Fall 2020 is highly unusual with the switch to online classes amidst the global COVID-19 pandemic, and I've adapted by becoming more flexible and offering more opportunities to resubmit work.

### FAQ's

> Do I have to attend class?

Class is where we'll cover the core material and do practice problems and other interactive activities, so plan on attending.
I do plan to record class meetings and make them available for you if you happen to miss one.


### Weekly Schedule

- 1 written hw or midterm - 5 hrs
- 2 (short) Mcgraw Hill hws - 2 hrs
- 1 discussion / participation activity - 1 to 3 hrs
