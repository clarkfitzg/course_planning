For STAT 50 I want to use more standard problems.
They should all fall into well recognized patterns- Bayes theorem, etc.
Some can be hard- that's OK.
The core course learning outcomes are being able to recognize and solve these problems.

Other outcomes include:

- Critically analyzing statistics and methodologies from various sources
- Basic calculations with R

My biggest question right now is how to design the grading scheme.
The original grading scheme was very typical for a math class:

- 5% Participation come to class, participate in activities
- 10% Homework each assignment is weighted equally. No makeups, lowest score will
be dropped.
- 10% Quizzes each quiz is weighted equally. No makeups, lowest score will be dropped.
- 40% Midterms each midterm is weighted equally. No makeups, lowest score will be
dropped.
- 35% Comprehensive Final Be there :)

I don't think this works at all online.

I definitely want to incorporate something team based during the class sessions.

I think having a retake policy with minimal penalty could make for a good disincentive for cheating.
Many small quizzes sounds better than big midterms.
Want to use games / team games.

We have Gradescope, which means grading actual handwritten work is feasible.

I don't really want to have projects in this class.
We'll already have homework, quizzes, discussions, videos, and midterms, which seems like enough.

I don't want to require synchronous quizzes- even though it could help mitigate cheating, there are too many logistic issues.

I should be really clear on which categories students can collaborate on, versus which I expect them to do individually, and find a balance between them.
I could have one category called "individual assignments".
Hmm, I wonder if Mcgraw Hill can randomize individual assignments?
Maybe it doesn't matter that much- the answers are still available.

Another tool at my disposal is to grade fewer problems than I assign.

Mcgraw Hill gives them practice with basic problems, along with in depth solutions (usually) and the ability to check their work.
The problem is that they can easily find the answers.
Mcgraw Hill should be worth something, so that they do it, but not too much.
10% sounds good.

How am I going to manage my workload?
One idea is to post student solutions to assignments that I grade in detail.
This saves me the work of having to write out the solution, and helps them review.

How to ensure academic integrity?
I'd like to disincentivize cheating as much as possible.


### Potential Activities

- homework, Mcgraw Hill automated
- homework, Mcgraw Hill manual
- discussions, read a relevant news article and analyze the statistics used.
    They can submit responses in videos or text.
- quizzes, Mcgraw Hill
- quizzes, Canvas
- written quiz where I give personal feedback
- written hw where I give personal feedback
- projects
- games, competition
- comprehensive final

Can I get away with not using Mcgraw Hill connect?
I don't want to use it, because I'm going to use Gradescope, and I don't want the students to have to deal with two external systems if I can help it.
The textbook has the answers to odd numbered questions in the book.
I can keep some minimal points for it, so that students are incentivized to actually do it.
I won't grade it- tell them, you grade it.
If there is a question on grades then I can go back and look at it, check whether they seriously did it or not.
