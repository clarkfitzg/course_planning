<p>STAT 50 - Means and histograms</p>
<h2 id="section">1</h2>
<p>Textbook, page 24, question 14.</p>
<h2 id="section-1">2</h2>
<ol type="a">
<li>In the 2016 US presidential election, Donald Trump ran against Hillary Clinton. Construct a frequency histogram of the percentage votes for Trump <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election_in_California#Results_by_county">per California county according to the Wikipedia page</a>. For example, in Sacramento County, 33.93% of the votes were for Trump. Use 0, 10, 20, …, 90, 100 as the break points. There are 58 counties in California.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hint: Sort the table based on votes for Trump, then count and construct a frequency table.</p>
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li><p>Which counties were at the far ends of this distribution? Did you expect this?</p></li>
<li><p>California historically votes for democratic presidents. What does this histogram tell you about the distribution of Trump voters across counties? Explain.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">3</h2>
<ol type="a">
<li>Come up with a single list of numbers that will make <strong>both</strong> of the following histograms:</li>
</ol>
<p>&lt;–!</p>
<p>x = c(0.5, 1.8, 2.5, 3.1, 4.5) par(mfrow = c(1, 2)) png(“twohistograms.png”) hist(x, breaks = 0:5) hist(x, breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 5, length.out = 4)) dev.off()</p>
<p>–&gt;</p>
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li><p>What can you conclude about histograms?</p></li>
<li><p>No points, extra challenge: Describe the set of all such numbers that will produce these two histograms.</p></li>
