1. Textbook, page 24, question 14.

2. Construct a frequency table with 5 bins for the following list of numbers:


1. Come up with a single list of numbers that will make __both__ of the following histograms:

<--!

x = c(0.5, 1.8, 2.5, 3.1, 4.5)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
hist(x, breaks = 0:5)
hist(x, breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 5, length.out = 4))

-->
What can you conclude about histograms?

Challenge: Describe the set of all such numbers that will produce these two histograms.
