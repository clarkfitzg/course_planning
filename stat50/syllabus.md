# Syllabus

Course: STAT 50 Introduction to Probability and Statistics

Term: Fall 2020

Instructor: Dr. Clark Fitzgerald

Textbook: Statistics for Engineers and Scientists, 5th edition by William Navidi.
You are _not_ required to purchase or rent a hard copy of the textbook, because an electronic version is included with the homework in McGraw Connect.
We will cover chapters 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6, omitting some sections.

Prerequisites: Math 26A, Math 30 or AP credit for AB calculus in high school.

### Grading Scheme

Percentage  |   Category    |   Description & Purpose     |   Collaboration Policy
----------  |   --------    |   -----------     |   ----------------------
10          | Practice Problems |   Online homework allows you to instantly check your work and see solutions, so that you can make sure you're on the right track. The purpose is to give you practice with standard calculations and concepts.   |   Collaboration is allowed.
25          | Homework      |   Expect these problem sets to challenge you more than those on the automated homework. I will grade a subset of these problems to provide you with feedback on your work, and allow you an opportunity to resubmit to correct any mistakes.    |   Talking about problems is allowed.
15          | Participation |   This category includes setting up online profiles, Canvas discussions, making review videos, and anything that doesn't fit cleanly somewhere else. The purpose is to make our online class feel more like a community by having some interaction with each other.    |   Collaboration is allowed.
20          | Midterms      |   Midterms will be similar to the homework, with a format that prepares you for the final. You will have an opportunity to resubmit the written parts to correct any mistakes. |   Do not collaborate.
30          | Final or Oral |   This is a standard final exam to assess how well you've learned the class concepts. It will be due at the end of the semester, which means you will NOT have an opportunity to resubmit. If there is any question on whether you followed the collaboration policy in this course, then I may schedule a one on one oral exam through Zoom video chat. The oral exam will be no more difficult than the written exam. |   Do not collaborate.

The goal of this grading scheme is to minimize the pressure on you, the student.
Fall 2020 is highly unusual with the switch to online classes amidst the global COVID-19 pandemic, and I've adapted by changing the course in the following ways:

1. Less weight on high stakes assessments
1. Fewer timed assessments
2. More flexibility around due dates and resubmissions

I'm not saying the course will be easy for you.
To succeed, you'll need to demonstrate that you understand the concepts, which will require many hours of concentrated studying. 


### Weekly Schedule

Expect to spend approximately 8 hours on activities outside of class for every 4 hours in class.
Some weeks will require more, some less.
You may find yourself spending more time if you need to review prerequisite math concepts, or you're working hard to earn a good grade.
That's OK!

This 

Activity                |   Expected Time
--------                |   -------------
written hw or midterm   |   3-6 hours
Mcgraw Hill practice problems       | 2 hours
discussion / participation activity | 1-3 hours


### Class Meetings

Class will meet MWF, one section at 8 AM and one section at 10 AM.
You may attend either section.

Class is where we'll cover the core material and do practice problems and other interactive activities, so plan on attending.
I do plan to record class meetings and make them available for you if you happen to miss one.
Experience shows that students perform better when they attend class, even online.


### Academic Honesty

Submit your own assignments, always.
On the grading rubric, "Collaboration is allowed" means you can help each other and work freely together, no worries.
"Do not collaborate" means you shouldn't receive any outside assistance, so don't talk about them.
The only exception is that you can ask me, the instructor, for clarification.

The category of the homework requires the most explanation.
You may work together and talk through the problems, but you need to understand each and every step in the solution that you turn in.
If you work together, please note on your submission who you worked with, and on which parts.


## Grading

The following weighting scheme determines your final grade.

- __5% Participation__ come to class, participate in activities
- __10% Homework__ each assignment is weighted equally. No makeups, lowest score will be dropped.
- __10% Quizzes__ each quiz is weighted equally. No makeups, lowest score will be dropped.
- __40% Midterms__ each midterm is weighted equally. No makeups, lowest score will be dropped.
- __35% Comprehensive Final__ No makeups.

The course grade cutoffs will follow the conventional scheme:

- 90-100% A
- 80-90% B
- 70-80% C
- 60-70% D
- Below 60% F

I _may_ adjust these grade cutoffs lower, so that students receive higher grades.
I will not raise the cutoffs.
This means, for example, that if you score 80% of the points, then your course grade will be a B- or better.


## Questions

If you have questions on the __course material or logistics__ that other students may also have, then try the following, in order:

1. Ask in lecture.
2. Ask in office hours.
3. Ask online in the Canvas discussion topics page.
   This allows your fellow students to benefit and participate.
   I always appreciate when another student can answer the question.
   Please read what's already there to avoid duplicating questions.

If you have a situation that requires __individual attention__, then come to office hours.
If it's urgent, or confidential, you may also email me at fitzgerald@csus.edu or call my office phone at (916) 278-4748.
Please don't email me questions about the course material.


## Academic Honesty

It's your responsibility to know and adhere to the University Policies regarding academic honesty, available at the following URL's:

- https://www.csus.edu/student-affairs/student-conduct/academic-dishonesty.html
- https://www.csus.edu/umanual/student/stu-100.htm

I will fully prosecute cheating.
If you have any question about what's appropriate, please ask.


## Writing Component

STAT 50 is an area B4 GE course and has a writing component. To satisfy the writing requirement graded
assignments involving writing and understanding of complex technical prose, interpretation of theoretical
ideas, and the use of mathematical ideas will be part of the course.


## Area B-4 Mathematical Concepts and Quantitative Reasoning Student Learning Outcomes

Students will be able to:

1. Solve problems by thinking logically, making conjectures, and constructing valid mathematical arguments.
2. Make valid inferences from numerical, graphical and symbolic information.
3. Apply mathematical reasoning to both abstract and applied problems, and to both scientific and non-scientific problems.
