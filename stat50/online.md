# Online Interactions

Online classes are scary new territory for me, and I expect they may be unfamiliar for you as well.
Here are a few thoughts for how to make this an enjoyable social experience.

Adopt the right tone for the media.
For example, I expect your midterm submissions to be clear and relatively formal.
In a casual setting such as Canvas discussions, submission comments, or chat, then you can be much more relaxed.
I've even gone way out of my comfort zone and started using emoticons. ðŸ˜Ž
They're more fun than I realized, and they add an element of humanity.
Appropriate GIF's are welcome too- this is the internet, after all!

Communicate with your fellow students.
I designed the participation assignments and discussions so that you can interact and have some exchange of ideas with others in the class.
I encourage you to form study groups and meet outside of class; let me know if I can help facilitate this.
Explaining a concept to another student is educational for both parties.

Be polite and considerate of others.
You never know how someone else might interpret what you say or write.
For example, sarcasm and profanity don't usually go over well in the classroom.
As students at Sac State, you're governed by about [50 Policies and Procedures](https://www.csus.edu/student-affairs/policy-procedures.html), and I'm sure that I'm governed by even more as a faculty member.
I've heard the rule of thumb that if you wouldn't say it in front of your grandmother, then don't say it in the virtual classroom.
This seems reasonable, based on most of the grandmothers I've met.

Use the homework assignment submission comments for private communication with me, the instructor.
I encourage you to use audio or video, and I plan to also.
For example, you can tell me what you struggled with in this assignment, or if you have something personal going on this week that prohibited you from doing as well as you usually do.
You can also talk with me about your classes and career plans, ask me about [my educational experiences](http://webpages.csus.edu/fitzgerald/my-education-path/), or ask for advice.
If you're experiencing relationship troubles, depression, or other issues more suitable for a trained counselor, then I may refer you to [Counseling Services](https://www.csus.edu/student-life/health-counseling/).
