Sample spaces, combinatorics, and random variables.
Density and distribution functions.
Expectation, variance, and covariance.
The binomial, uniform, poisson, negative binomial, hypergeometric, exponential, gamma, beta, and normal distributions.
Sampling distributions, estimation, and hypothesis tests.
Students are given periodic writing assignments which encourage them to think through concepts of the course.
